# 307
Implementations of various important algorithms I learned about in CMPT 307.
Run `make` to compile. This will produce the following executables:
* graphs
* more to come...

# Contents
* graphs (compile with `make graphs`)
  * driver.c - Graph input and driver program
  * dijkstra.c - Contains implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
  * priority_queue.c - Contains a priority queue implementation for dijkstra.c
