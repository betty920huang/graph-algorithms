# 307
Implementations of various important algorithms I learned about in CMPT 307.
Run `make` or `make all` to compile. This will produce the following executables:
* graphs
* more to come...

## Contents
* graphs (compile with `make graphs`)
  * driver.c - Graph input / driver program
  * dijkstra.c - Implementation of Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm
